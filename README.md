# Rock-Paper-Scissor

This project will capture your image from your webcam and classify the gesture you did in it whether it is rock, paper or scissor.

* The file RPS_model.ipynb is used to get dataset, preprocessing the dataset, create a model, and training model. After training on colab I have saved this model to as *.h5 file* and used it on local machine with output.ipynb

* Output.ipynb file will use pretrained model and capture image from webcam and then classify it.
